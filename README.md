Building a router service can be challenging. Metrogo core is written with Python version 3 and uses simple graph and Dijastra algorithm to find the shortest path. It is not specific to the metro. It can be used to make bus, intercity train, or even airline routes. If you are interested in graphic navigation such as Google Map and Apple Map, etc. You can read this website.
